# Skin_Disease_Prediction
This is a project about Skin Detection Prediction.


Skin disease is currently a big issue for people all around the world. The many kinds of skin diseases can be predicted using various machine learning algorithms. Many illness diagnosis categorization algorithms have been created in order to predict diseases with high accuracy. The suggested system is used to forecast the seven different forms of skin conditions, including 

* Keratosis (Actinic)

* Keratosis (Benign)

* Carcinoma

* Dermatofibroma

* Melanoma

* Skin Ailment

* Malignant nevus

The model is trained with 50 epoches to get the best results from the data we collected. The results of our model's training utilising various compilers are as follows. The local computer that we used for training has a Ryzen 550U processor and 8GB of RAM.

As can be seen from the comparison above, training a model on a local machine requires a lot of time, making it impossible for a student to complete. Nevertheless, by using cloud compilers like Google Colab and Intel OneApi, we substantially cut the time, making it easier and more accessible for students to learn AI and ML.
